# stocks-analysis
Analyze stock performance with financial data using VBA

# Overview of Project
We have helped Steve find out how DAQO performed in 2018 by analyze DAQO's yearly return using VBA. And the result shows DAQO might not be the best option. So 
we went a little bit further, created code in VBA, which can analyze all stocks for any year. Steve is happy with that.

In this project, we will refactor the code we created for Steve to to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information faster.

# Result
## Runtime - Original code

From the elapsed time shown on above pictures, we can see that there's a huge improvement in the runtime in the refactored code.

# Summary
## Advantages of Refactoring codes
Refactoring will code makes code more efficient with fewer steps.

Refactoring code will imporves run time of Macro.

## Disadvantages od Refactoring codes
Might be time consuming with large and complicate codes.

Might cause unexpected errors with complicated codes.
